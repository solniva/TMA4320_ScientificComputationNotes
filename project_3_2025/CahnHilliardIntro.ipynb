    "\n",

E.g. for a time-stepping method, describe in mathematical terms how you compute the solution at the next time step based on the solution at the current time step. This will help you to avoid mistakes and to understand the behavior of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Well-documented code.** Make sure that your code is well documented,  in particular that you write a short description of the purpose of each function \n",
    "in the form of docstrings and that you provide inline comments  (1-2 lines) briefly explaining the relevant code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Presentation of results.** When presenting results, do not just e.g. show a picture of a solution\n",
    "or display a convergence table, but make sure that you comment on\n",
    "your results sufficiently, in particular when we asked guiding\n",
    "questions or if the results are unexpected, or if you observe something\n",
    "interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualizations.** Include visualizations of your results to illustrate your findings.\n",
    "You can use the plotting/animation functions provided in the `project_tools.py` module which you can find in this folder. Alternatively, you can of course use your own plotting functions. **But when you submit your final report, make sure that you remove all cell outputs\n",

    "storage and make the notebook unnecessarily large. Instead we will ask you to either provide pictures of solution snapshots or to generate a more lightweight gif animation consisting of a few frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For interactive visualizations where you can zoom in/out, make animation etc. you should execute the magic command `%matplotlib widget` once somewhere in the beginning of the notebook. But when you generate the final \n",
    "    report, switch back to `%matplotlib inline` to avoid large notebook files/storage of animations.\n",
