    "In this section, we have a glance at how the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used to process images. The FFT is a powerful tool for analyzing the frequency content of signals, including images. By transforming an image into the frequency domain, we can manipulate its frequency components to achieve various effects, such as filtering, compression, and enhancement.\n",
