    "### Implementation of time-stepping schemes using generator functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are generator functions in Python?** \n",
    "Any Python function that has the ```yield``` keyword in its body is a generator function: a\n",
    "function which, when called, returns a generator object. (In other words, a generator\n",
    "function is a generator factory.)\n",
    "A generator function builds a generator object that wraps the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are iterators, but you can only iterate over them once. It's because they do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly. You use them by iterating over them, either with a 'for' loop or explicitly applying the 'next()' function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, the main advantage of using generator functions is that they\n",
    "allow us to write code that is more readable and more efficient as it\n",
    "avoids the need to store all the time steps in memory. In project 3,\n",
    "you will be asked to perform a time-stepping method that requires a\n",
    "large number of time steps (4000) on a large grid (256x256). In this\n",
    "case, storing all the time steps in memory would be very inefficient\n",
    "and will highly likely lead to a memory error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not immediately invert the IFFT at each time step?**\n",
    "In the implementation below, we do not invert the IFFT at each time step. This is because the IFFT is despite its $\\mathcal{O}(N)\\log(N)$ complexity an expensive operation, and we want to avoid it as much as possible. Instead, we store the Fourier coefficients at each time step and invert the IFFT only if relevant, e.g. if we want to plot the solution at\n",
    "certain time steps or compute a quantity of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the time-stepping schemes using generator functions in the following code snippet. We will also use the [`tqdm` package](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) to display a progress bar during the time-stepping."
